# High Current 5V DC Buck Converter Board
This board is a high current (8A) buck converter based around the TPS51386 for providing USB power to multiple devices from one board. Focused around working from a 4S Lithium Ion battery, it should work for any input voltage source from 10V-26V DC. The board also incorporates two INA219A PMICs for monitoring input & output power over I2C.
